# Example 2 â€“ Fine-Tuning of Mo and GSFE Calculation

This repository contains the **second example** from our tutorial paper.

## Contents

- A script for **fine-tuning foundation models** on your target dataset.
- A script for **computing the Generalized Stacking Fault Energy (GSFE)**.

## Usage

Please refer to the comments in each script for instructions on how to run them.  
Make sure all required dependencies are installed before running the scripts.

## Notes

This example demonstrates how to adapt pretrained models to specific tasks and how to evaluate material properties such as GSFE using machine-learned interatomic potentials.
